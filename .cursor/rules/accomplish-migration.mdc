# Migration Rules
- Use `@disable_ddl_transaction true` and `@disable_migration_lock true`.
- Define `up/0` and `down/0` explicitly.
- Use UUID primary keys where appropriate with the `UUIDv7` package.
- Create indexes concurrently (`CONCURRENTLY`).
- Ensure foreign keys and constraints are properly indexed.
