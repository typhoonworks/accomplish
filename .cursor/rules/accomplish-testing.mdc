# Testing Rules

- **All tests must be structured using `describe` blocks and `setup` functions** for better readability and reusability.
- **Fixtures should always receive their parent entities** rather than creating associations inside the fixture function.
- **Use test fixtures for creating entities** instead of setting up data manually in test cases.
- **Fixtures should be defined inside `test/support/fixtures/` and imported automatically in `DataCase`**.
- **`DataCase` must be used for database-related tests** and should always start the SQL sandbox.
- **Tests that require a connection must use `ConnCase`**.
- **Database interactions should always use Ectoâ€™s sandboxing approach** to ensure data is rolled back between tests.
- **Assertions should be specific and meaningful** to ensure test reliability.
- **Ensure async testing is only enabled where safe (`use Accomplish.DataCase, async: true`)**.
- **Prefer explicit test names** that describe the behavior under test.
- **Every context function should have corresponding test coverage**.
- **Use `errors_on/1` to validate changeset errors** rather than manually inspecting error tuples.
- **When testing deletion, verify that the entity is no longer retrievable from the database**.
- **Always test edge cases, such as invalid input, missing fields, and foreign key constraints**.
