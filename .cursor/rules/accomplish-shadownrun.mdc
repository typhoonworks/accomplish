# Shadowrun Component Rules

- **Core Shadownrun components** live in [shadowrun_components.ex](mdc:lib/accomplish_web/components/shadowrun_components.ex)
- **Complex Shadowrun components must be placed inside `lib/accomplish_web/components/shadowrun/`**.
- Component files should follow the naming convention `AccomplishWeb.Shadowrun.ComponentName`.
- Use `Phoenix.Component` and `LiveSvelte.Components` to ensure compatibility with Phoenix LiveView and Svelte.
- Components should support `:class`, `:rest`, and `slot :inner_block` unless unnecessary.
- Class merging should be done using `TwMerge.merge/1` in a `classes/1` function to ensure proper Tailwind class handling.
- Component variants must be handled with helper functions, e.g., `button_variant_class/1`.
- Reusable elements (icons, buttons, etc.) should be separate components within `shadowrun/`.
- For UI interactivity, use `Phoenix.LiveView.JS` instead of inline JavaScript to ensure LiveView reactivity.
- Form components should follow the structure of `shadow_form/1` and `shadow_input/1` for consistency.
- Ensure components are built with accessibility (`aria-*` attributes) in mind.
- Styles should be minimal, dark-mode-first, and aligned with the Linear.app and Warp-style UI.
- Dropdowns, modals, and sidebars should use `JS.show/JS.hide` for toggling visibility.
- Interactive elements (buttons, inputs, dropdowns) should use proper focus states and keyboard navigation.
